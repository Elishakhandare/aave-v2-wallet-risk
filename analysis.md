Credit Score Distribution Analysis
After running the wallet scoring script, we assigned scores between 0 to 1000 to each wallet based on their historical DeFi transaction behavior on the Aave V2 protocol.

We bucketed the wallets into the following ranges for better understanding:

Score Range	Number of Wallets	Behavior Summary
0–100	     Very few	  Possibly bots, almost no deposits, high borrow or unusual activity
100–400	   Moderate	  Low activity, low repayment ratio, possibly inactive
400–700	   Many	      Decent deposit history, some borrow and repayment
700–900	   Most	      Active, responsible users with good repay ratio
900–1000	 Very few  	High deposit amounts, excellent repay ratio, likely safe wallets

 Observations
Majority of wallets fall in the 700–900 range, indicating responsible behavior.
Wallets with repay ratios near or over 1.0 received higher scores.
Very low scores were assigned to wallets with either:
  # No activity besides borrowing
  # Repay ratios close to 0
  # Only one suspicious transaction

Conclusion
This scoring system helps us categorize wallets from high-risk to safe participants. It could be further improved by including on-chain metadata, token prices over time, or advanced ML techniques—but for now, this basic behavior-based score provides a good start.
